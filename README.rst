punkweb-boards
=====================

Note: Rename from django-boards to punkweb-boards, sorry for any inconvience.

Django forum boards with bbcode support.

This project aims to be a full featured **classic style** forum board.  As opposed to the
new *modern* style of discussion board, such as discourse.

Demo/Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out our community at `PunkWeb <https://punkweb.us/board/>`__ for a
live demonstration of punkweb-boards, or view the
`documentation <https://punkweb.us/board/page/docs-index/>`__!

I'm just getting started on the documentation, there's dozens of pages I still
need to write out, but what's there now should help get you started.

Ready (somewhat) for use!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Punkweb is currently being hosted in production using Punkweb Boards for it's forum
software.  With that being said, you could very well use this in production for your
own community but only if you're willing to accept some things to not work or be
as robust as you'd like for the time being.

Now that the project is designed as a reusable app format, you could start using it
today, and be pleasantly surprised when things change.

Check out the 'Ready' milestone under issues to see what's left before I release
a solid v1.0.0.
